# Character Creation

## Traits

Characters are defined by their **traits**. Each trait has a numeric **level**.

Your character traits tell us about your super-powers, skills, attitudes, and experiences.
If you could summarize your character by saying "he is (blank)" or "she has (blank)" or "they can (blank)", that’s probably a trait.

You can change your traits during Letters to the Editor.

Example traits:

* Optic Blasts
* Healing Factor
* Weather Control
* Tough as Nails
* Super-Intellect
* Boundless Compassion

## STUN

All characters have a special trait called STUN. It has a fixed level of 10.
Rather than rolling it during combat or to accomplish something,
you roll for effect (called **recharging the pool**) at a predefined point during the game, and keep track of the total.
You lose any previous effect in a pool when you recharge it.

* Recharge at the start of every scene, or if you spend a Page of combat time without appearing
* You can take the standard effect (30 STUN) if you want
* Lose 1 STUN per point of damaging effect directed at you
* If you are out of STUN, you are unconscious or otherwise out of the fight (unless you specified another defeat condition)

----

## Complications

A complication is anything that can disrupt your life as a hero, or make a situation messier or more interesting.
You should take between 3 and 5 complications, with no more than 15 total levels.

Examples:

* Vulnerable to electricity
* Hunted by the FBI
* Powerless in sunlight
* Helpless Aunt June
* Afraid of heights

Complications serve two purposes:
to give you bonus levels in play when the complication arises,
and to indicate to the GM what sorts of situations you want your character to face.

When you bring a complication into play as part of a roll, add the levels of that complication to the levels you're rolling.

### Scene Complications

These work like character complications, but are introduced by the GM during play and aren't attached to a particular character. Unlike character complications, scene complications are "used up" when their levels add to a roll.

### Villain Complications

Villains have complications, but these don't benefit them.
Instead, if you believe a villain has a complication and invoke it,
you gain the benefit.

For example, a villain with "Arrogant 5" might be haughty and dominating on the battlefield.
If you can trick them into over-extending themselves, you can invoke Arrogant to your benefit.

----

## Build Points

Players receive 30 Build Points (BP) and create a character from that.

Spend 1 BP to add one level to an existing trait or buy 1 level in a new trait. A range of 2-8 levels is probably appropriate for most traits. Traits with 10-12 levels are very strong.

You should buy a range of traits that cover most of the situations you want your character to handle. Buy some very generic traits (e.g. "Dexterity", "Intelligence").

Complications never cost BP.

## Example Character

We’ll build a ninja detective, named Nightsong, with 30 BP. She has the following traits:

* Agile 7
* Presence 6
* Smart 5
* Martial Arts 3
* Ninja Gadgets 6
* Detective 3

She has the following complications:

**Hunted by Ninja Clan 3** - her old clan is still on her trail and wants her back

* During a fight, she adds these levels to a defense, but it’s because a flurry of shuriken suddenly came her way, signaling some ninja hunters are now on the scene too
* A forensic investigation roll gets the bonus if signs of the clan’s involvement are present - what could they want?
* A persuasion or other social roll succeeds, but the clan is monitoring the conversation and will now come for her

----

**Never Gives Up 4** - she’s focused and dedicated to her mission, but sometimes won’t back down even when she ought to

* Add level to an attack or defense to stay in the fight when she is outnumbered and likely to lose
* Add level to actions that’ll commit her to some course of action (e.g. getting onto a ship that’s about to leave dock)

**Secret Identity 3** - she does not want to get outed by the public

* Bonus to social interactions that introduce a risk of discovery
* Bonus when people or places in her mundane life become an element in vigilante work (e.g. a coworker is hurt, her day job’s headquarters is targeted, her boss is a supervillain)

**Orphan Sidekick 5** - she has a kid helping her in her vigilante work

* She and her sidekick team up for an attack, but the sidekick becomes a target for counterattacks
* Sidekick helps with the investigation by running errands or distracting police, but might be questioned, abducted, or spied on
* Sidekick has their own life which will drag Nightsong into a bad situation

# Effect

When a rule says to make a roll, you'll need to know the **level** you are rolling, and (optionally) an **opposing level**.

If you have no applicable levels at all, but the challenge is something an ordinary person ought to be capable of attempting, you get a default level of 1.

If you are **rolling for success**, roll 3d6. If you get equal or less than (10 + your level - the opposing level), the effect is Success. Otherwise, it's Failure.

If you are **rolling for effect**, roll a number of d6 equal to your level, minus the opposing level.
If this would be a negative number, you get no effect. Otherwise, add up all the dice. The total is your effect.

Instead of rolling for effect, you can take the standard effect:
3 * (your level - the opposing level), with a minimum value of 0.

The GM is encouraged to use standard effect when a PC and NPC come into opposition, to reduce rolling.

----

## When do I roll for success vs. effect?

Roll for success when an effect would be all-or-nothing, e.g. invasive mind control, a mystical curse, or an ultra-deadly ray gun. Roll for effect when you are comparing strengths, or when it's likely a hit will happen but it's not certain how bad it will be.

## Who rolls?

In general, players ought to roll for their PCs, and the GM should take the standard effect for NPCs.
If a villain attacks a PC, the player's roll is to defend or mitigate the effect.

## Examples

The ninja hero Nightsong wants to sneak past a squad of guards patrolling the Tower of Terror.
Her level for stealth is 8, and their level of perceptiveness is 5.
She rolls 3d6, trying to beat (10 + 8 - 5), or 13. She rolls an 11, succeeding.

Later, Nightsong needs to unleash a flurry of shuriken at an enemy robot!
She's doing damage, so she rolls for effect with a level of 10 (for using her ninja gadgets)
minus 6 (the robot's armored carapace). She rolls 4d6, doing a total of 13 points of damage.

# Playing the Game

## Issue Cover

When characters are ready and the game begins, the GM will briefly describe the scene on the cover of this Issue.
This could be the team struggling against an enemy, being challenged by a natural disaster,
or anything else the GM thinks would be interesting.
This is a convenient way for the GM to introduce a new villain or advertise a threat.

However, there is no guarantee that this will come to pass!
Comic covers often lie, and yours can too.
Nobody should feel compelled to make the cover a reality in the game.
The point is to get things rolling with the idea of _something_ happening, rather than railroad the plot.

## Actions and Outcomes

When you declare what you’re doing, and it has a chance of not going the way you want,
announce which trait or traits you’re applying to the problem, and add up their levels.

The trait(s) you use must make sense in the moment.
You can attack enemies at range with an Optic Blast, or solve a scientific riddle with Super-Intellect,
but it’s hard to justify using a Healing Factor to charm a diplomat into sharing a secret with you.

If the roll would be opposed, ask the GM for the opposed level.

## Time Intervals

Time is divided like this:

* Panels (any actions that would fit in a comic book panel, up to a few seconds' worth of time)
* Pages (six Panels, or several seconds of time)
* Spreads (a special Panel going into a lot of detail or showing something especially dramatic)
* Issues (a single game session, expected to take 2-4 hours of play)
* Collections (several issues which create a story arc)

# Combat

## Defeat Conditions

When you enter a fight, you declare a defeat condition:
what will remove you from the fight, either causing you to stop fighting, flee, pass out, be captured, etc.
If you don't have an answer, the default is "lose all your STUN".
The defeat condition must be achievable in the fight, and it can be changed mid-fight with the GM's permission.

## Resolving Combat

Every Page, the GM will determine starting **Danger** by rolling 2d6.
If anyone was taken out in the previous Page, roll 1d6 instead.
Any time you roll an ability, no level (your level or the opposed level) can exceed the current Danger.

Every Page, everyone declares which Panels they'll be in.
Declare in order of highest STUN to lowest STUN.
For ties, declare in any order you want.
Players can pre-negotiate positioning between themselves and/or with the GM before committing to an order,
but please don't waste a lot of time doing this.

You can add yourself to up to 3 Panels.

Any Panels without occupants will be filled with Establishing Shots by the GM, which can set up Scene Complications or otherwise advance the story.

If you aren't in a Panel, you can't act, but you also can't be acted upon.

If you are in a Panel, but don't take any mechanical action (e.g. attacking or defending),
you can narrate a **Reaction Shot** to the ongoing situation, and increase the Danger by 1-3 (your choice).

Once everyone is placed, play through panel by panel. Resolve actions in the order of lowest STUN to highest STUN.

----

## Effect to Levels

When you're called on to turn an effect amount rolled on the dice into a number of levels, it works like this:

1 point of effect = 1 level for Rare effects ("Zymoxian superpowers")
2 points of effect = 1 level for Uncommon effects ("tunneling underground")
3 points of effect = 1 level for Common effects ("fire-related powers")
4 points of effect = 1 level for Very Common effects ("any movement")

## Spending Effect

You can spread your effect amount across any or all of these outcomes.

* Harm - reduce target's STUN by effect amount
* Penalty - create a scene complication that resists certain actions, like "Entangle 4 vs. all movement". Lasts until Canceled or negated by the fiction. Use Effect to Levels.
* Cancel - reduce a scene complication's levels by the effect amount. Use Effect to Levels.

### TODO

* Wide Shot - apply the standard effect to everyone in the Panel with you, e.g. Area-Effect Attacks
* Negate - reduce some other power's level by the level of this one, e.g. Armor-Piercing attacks

----

# Letters to the Editor

At the end of every Issue, the GM should ask each player to describe their Letter to the Editor, or LTTE.
This is something a fan might write if they'd read the comic book that was just described.
A LTTE should include some or all of the following:

* Something about another player's PC that you want to see more (or less) of, like an ongoing storyline, complication, or scene
* An area where another player's PC is too weak or too strong
* Anything else you'd like to see more or less of in play, like favorite plot elements or villains

Your LTTE can talk about as many or as few other PCs as you can think of.

When everyone has talked about their LTTE, each player can make adjustments to their own PC.
Players gain one BP if any of the following happened:

* You changed your character following guidance from at least two different LTTEs
* Your character complications came up during the Issue, and were recognized in at least one LTTE

Players can update anything that was called out in a LTTE directed at them
by reassigning their total Build Points to change their traits, or get traits
at different levels than before.
