# Game Design v3.0

# Getting started
- This is a game about creating comic-book superhero action for 2-6 players
- One player will be the Editor
- All other players will play Heroes
- Players will need about 12d6 maximum
- The Editor usually narrates for, and has final say over, all non-Hero characters
## Character tracking
- You can make a copy of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PbOK0WGsoag3oM5wmrpby5YcdgpdQftDQQV_8pnIYUA/edit?usp=sharing) to record characters
- Click on **File > Make a copy**
- Enter your Hero’s name in the uppermost colored row and your player name below that
- Enter traits and complications by name, then level, e.g. “Strong” and “8”
- Use the checkboxes next to traits and complications to indicate that they are locked (during character creation, leave these unchecked)
# Starting the game
- First, glance over the [TTRPG Safety Toolkit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/114jRmhzBpdqkAlhmveis0nmW73qkAZCj) and adopt the safety tool(s) the group prefers
- Second, talk about what “comic book” means for the group
    - Astro City, Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe, and My Little Pony are all “comic books”
    - How serious do you want to be? How campy? How cosmic?
- Third, come up with Hero concepts!
    - The Editor assists other players in creating their Hero characters
- Fourth, start playing the series!
    - The game represents a **series**, starting with the introduction of the Heroes
    - The series is made up of **issues**, played out over the length of your game session
    - Issues are broken up into **scenes**, where stuff happens
## Principles of play
- Craft your comic book as a team
- When another player seems hesitant to speak, encourage them
- Give the Editor the last word, but don’t make them do all the talking
- It’s only as serious or as silly as you want it to be
- Adversity is the lens through which we see a Hero’s soul
- Give the Heroes some personal stake in the action
- Give every villain a recognizable motivation, even if it’s an awful one
- Use continuity and callbacks to reward player investment
- Retcon or rewrite whatever isn’t working for you right now
# Rolling dice
## Rolling for success
- Make this roll when you need to answer a yes-or-no question, e.g. “did I defuse the bomb?”, “do I remain concealed?”
- The Editor will tell you **your level**, and an **opposing level**
    - You have a default level of 2 for typical human activities: running, noticing details, having a conversation with someone
    - If nothing else applies (e.g. defusing a bomb when you have no idea how), your default level is zero
- Roll 3d6, against a target of (9 + your level - the opposing level)
    - Equal or under this target is a **success**
    - Over this target is a **failure**
## Rolling for effect
- Make this roll when you need a degree of effectiveness, e.g. “how persuasive was I?”, “how damaging was my attack?”, “how fast did I run?”
- The Editor will tell you **your level**
    - You have a default level of 2 for typical human activities: running, noticing details, having a conversation with someone
    - If nothing else applies (e.g. defusing a bomb when you have no idea how), you cannot roll for effect
- Roll (your level) d6 and sum the numbers shown on the dice
- If the roll is opposed, the Editor compares this with the **standard effect**: 3 times the **opposing level**
## Who rolls?
- Only Hero players roll dice
- If an Editor character is doing something to a Hero that would be a roll, have the Hero roll to oppose it instead
- Don’t roll if a success and/or failure wouldn’t take the story somewhere
| ## Examples<br>- Nightsong (Stealth 6) wants to avoid some guards on patrol (default level 2). She rolls 3d6 against a target number of (9 + 6 - 2). If she succeeds, she remains hidden. Otherwise, she’s spotted.<br>- The Incredible Bulk (Smash 8) punches his NPC nemesis Slab (Stoneskin 7). Bulk rolls 8d6 for effect, getting 31. As an NPC, Slab takes the standard effect of (7 * 3) or 21. Bulk gets a net effect of 10 points. |

# Effect to Level
- Sometimes, you’ll need to turn some amount of **effect** back into **levels**, such as when creating complications
- The Editor declares how rarely the effect will apply:
    - For Rare effects (“Zymoxian superpowers”), 1 point of effect gives 1 level
    - For Uncommon effects (“tunneling underground”), 2 points of effect gives 1 level
    - For Common effects (“fire-related powers”), 3 points of effect gives 1 level
    - For Very Common effects (“any movement”), 4 points of effect gives 1 level
| ## Examples<br>- Siege (Charm 5) wants to convince a crowd of onlookers to get to safety before a villain attacks again. He rolls 5d6 for effect and gets 15. Nobody in the crowd is inclined to resist. Siege wants to create a complication on the crowd like “Safety First”. The Editor thinks this would Commonly affect the crowd’s actions, so divides 15 by 3.<br>    - The crowd now has a complication with 5 levels.<br>    - This complication will resist any effort by the crowd to do something risky<br>- Socket (Inventor 6) needs to whip up some nanotech neutralizers to stop the city from turning into gray goo. She rolls 6d6 for effect, getting 14. This is an Uncommon effect, so taking 14/2 lets her inflict a complication on the nanobots with 7 levels. |

# Creating characters
## The process
- Come up with a **name** (superhero name and/or real name), **heraldry** (your costume, symbol, and other visual indicators), and **backstory** (where you came from and what you’re about)
- Buy 30 points worth of **traits**, spread across 4-6 individual traits
- Buy up to 15 points worth of **complications**, spread across 3-5 individual complications
## Traits
- Characters have **traits** with numeric **levels**, e.g. “Super-Strength 6”
- Use traits to tell us who you are, what you have, or what you do
- Traits are how you get stuff done during the game
- Traits are fictionally real - if you have “Super-speed” as a trait, your Hero is always fast, even if you aren’t rolling dice
- A typical human has traits in the 2-4 range, while typical superhuman traits are 5-8 and exceptional traits are 9+
    - The Editor can specify an upper limit for trait levels
- Traits can be changed at the end of an issue via fan mail
## Picking traits
- If you don’t have a clear idea of what kind of character you’re playing, pick a random superpower to start with. Visit this link: https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Random
- Try picking traits from this list:
    - Your major superpower (e.g. Optic Blasts, Healing Factor, Weather Control)
    - A signature move you make with that power (e.g. Body of Ice, Fastball Special)
    - One or two general qualities that defines you (Agile, Tough as Nails, Boundless Compassion)
    - A habit or distinction you have (Snarky Quips, Meticulous Planner)
    - A job, role, or responsibility (Cub Reporter, Detective, Ninja, Forest Guardian)
- Give your traits catchy, comic-book-y names, e.g. “Seductive Lure” rather than “he has the ability to attract people”
- Could your Hero say “But, wait, villain, you haven’t counted on my… (trait name)”?
## Complications
- Complications are a special form of trait, also given a name and a level
- Use complications to develop rivalries or romances, disrupt your Hero’s status quo, or otherwise keep their lives “interesting”
- Complications can make you more effective or keep you in the fight, but only if they’ve come into play in the fiction
- Minor complications have 1-2 levels, moderate ones 3-4, and major ones 5-6
    - The Editor can specify an upper limit for complication levels
- Like traits, complications can change during play
## Picking complications
- Complications tell the Editor what kind of stories you want to happen to your Hero
- Don’t take complications that are also regular traits - make it one or the other
- Try picking complications from this list:
    - A super-weakness (Vulnerable to Electricity, Powerless in Sunlight)
    - A connection with a character or group (Wanted by the FBI, Helpless Aunt June)
    - A source of inner conflict (Afraid of Heights, Secret Identity, Code of Honor)
- Could your Hero say “oh no! I’m (complication)”, or “oh no! My (complication)”?
# Playing an issue
## The basics
- At the start of each issue, the Editor describes an **issue cover**
- For the rest of the session, all players engage in conversation and use the rules to determine how the issue plays out, **scene** by scene
- The Editor can frame scenes using **pages and panels** when there’s a time-critical conflict, such as combat or a risky rescue mission
- Once the issue feels like it’s ready to wrap, whether with closure or on a cliffhanger, the Editor guides the players through **fan mail**
## The issue cover
- The Editor describes the scene on the cover of a hypothetical comic book
    - This could be the team struggling against an enemy, being challenged by a natural disaster, heroes reacting to a shocking revelation, or anything else interesting
    - Comic covers often lie, and yours can too - the point is to get things rolling with the idea of *something* happening
    - The cover is a convenient way for the Editor to introduce a new villain or advertise a threat
- The Editor should listen to how the other players react to the cover, and focus or discard elements that do or don’t seem to grab their interest
## Scenes
- Each issue is broken up into **scenes**
    - The Editor announces when a new scene has started
    - All players reset their Heroes’ **resolve** to 30 (see below)
- During the scene, players describe what their characters do
    - The Editor introduces characters and situations that challenge the Heroes and play to both their strengths and weaknesses
    - The Hero players use their characters’ traits and complications to meet these challenges and pursue their agendas
    - Where appropriate, the Editor calls for dice rolls to see how effective the Heroes are
## Resolve
- Characters start each new scene with 30 points of **resolve**
    - Powerful villains, giant monsters, etc. gain 15 points of resolve per “tier” or “power level” above the heroes
- Resolve represents several things
    - Your physical and mental health - how beat up you are
    - Your emotional state - how willing you are to keep going in the face of danger
    - Your unwillingness to back down, no matter how bad it is
- Resolve isn’t a resource you build up - if you want to hit someone extra hard, either use a Spread, or pile on some complications first
- During the scene, you can regain resolve through certain actions
- There’s no maximum for resolve
- Attacks and other sources of damage reduce your resolve
- If you run out of resolve, you are out of the scene
    - You fall unconscious, run away, give up, are captured, etc.
    - The Hero’s player gets the last word on how this happens
## Using traits and complications
- You can **invoke** a trait or complication by narrating it coming to pass, e.g. “I use my Optic Blast to hit Evilon” or “my enemies, the Shin Clan Ninja, suddenly appear”
- You can’t invoke a trait unless it makes sense in the fiction, e.g. you can’t use Martial Arts against someone who’s not in range of your punches and kicks
## Invoking for resolve
- Heroes can invoke a trait or complication to gain resolve, equal to 3 times its level
- You can invoke for resolve immediately if you drop to 0 resolve
- The trait must be applicable or the complication must be at stake, or come into play
- You can’t invoke the trait or complication again for the rest of the scene - the trait is “locked”
- You can unlock a trait or complication by paying back the resolve you earned from it
- Traits unlock at the end of a scene
| ## Examples<br>- “I’ll be using my **Ice Wall** to deflect incoming attacks, and unleashing ice blasts!” This is an example of a character who has a specific defensive trait<br>- “Because I’m **Agile**, I’ll be dodging and weaving everything during the combat.” Characters can use their general traits, if they aren’t getting <br>- “These henchmen are easy to keep off balance, as long as I keep making **Cutting Quips**.” Characters should remember their “non-combat” traits and use them to keep the action interesting and fun<br>- “I get up off the ground. My **Rivalry with Evilon** won’t let me stop until he’s apprehended!” Complications are a great way to get extra resolve during a fight, and they encourage Heroes to come up with meaningful complications, and Editors to include them |

## Invoking for action
- If you’re invoking to accomplish something, the Editor calls for a roll, and tell you whether it’s for success or effect
    - Yes-or-no decisions (“am I hidden?”) are rolls for success
    - Degrees of success (“how much damage did I do?”) are rolls for effect
    - The level for this roll is the trait or complication level
    - You can invoke at most one trait and at most one complication, but if you invoke both, you add their levels together
- When you roll for effect, you can spend it in various ways, including:
    - Applied as damage against another character’s resolve
    - Converting effect to levels to create a new scene complication, or overcome an existing one
- When you invoke a **trait** while inside a panel (see below), you pay resolve equal to the level of that trait
    - If you’re only invoking to resist someone else’s actions, you only pay half as much resolve, rounded up
| ## Examples<br>- Nightsong uses her Ninja Gadgets 6 trait to throw explosive bombs at the Soviet sniper Marxman<br>- Nightsong pays 6 resolve for using the trait<br>- Marxman defends with his Five Year Planning 5 trait, paying 3 resolve (half of 5, rounded up)<br>- Nightsong rolls 6d6 for effect and gets 25<br>- Marxman takes the standard effect of 15<br>- The net effect is (25 - 15) or 10, so Marxman loses another 10 resolve |

## Invoking complications
- Invoking complications work like invoking traits, but you never pay resolve to invoke a complication for action
- You can invoke complications on villains by playing on their weaknesses, e.g. taking advantage of a villain’s “Arrogance” complication to get them to monologue while you prepare an attack
- You can invoke complications on the scene if it makes sense, e.g. “there’s Burning Automobiles, so I throw one at the villain”
- Nobody can invoke the same complication a second time until the fallout from a previous invocation has been addressed to the Editor’s satisfaction, e.g. you can’t repeatedly attack a villain by invoking the same “Arrogant” complication over and over in the scene
- The Editor can invoke a character or scene complication to oppose any character’s actions at any time it seems relevant
    - The Editor should do this to give Hero complications teet
| ## Examples<br>- Plasmaster wants to hit someone with his **Fusion Fireball** (level 6)**,** but he’s also got a complication called **Collateral Damage** (level 4). He can invoke both for 10 levels of effect, and only pay 6 resolve, but the resulting blast may endanger civilians, light things on fire, or bring down a building!<br>- “Hey, what if suddenly the **RATS Hit Squad** that’s hunting me bursts in?” Heroes can introduce new complications to the scene, making things messier for themselves in exchange for a momentary advantage.<br>- Nightsong wants to pursue a fleeing villain, but her **Orphan sidekick** is hurt. The Editor rules that the complication will oppose any of her rolls to pursue, because she should be tending to him. |

## Spreads
- Each player (Editor and Hero) can take control of the narrative once per issue, via a **spread**
- Think of a spread as a full-page illustration in a comic book, flashy and cinematic, rather than action confined to individual panels
- You can invoke any one of your traits (and optionally, complications) to make a roll that is never opposed and does not cost resolve
- This roll can have any effect it normally would, e.g. do damage
- Instead of rolling, name one thing that would keep you going in the situation against all odds, and stand up with 15 resolve, even if you were previously taken out
- Example spreads:
    - A grand entrance of a character who wasn’t on the scene
    - Unleashing a powerful attack or devastating combo
    - Revealing a turnabout ploy or dramatic twist
## Fan mail
- At the end of the issue, the Editor asks each player to provide fan mail
- This is what a typical fan of the comic book might write after reading the current issue
- Fan mail should include at least one of:
    - Something about another player’s Hero, Villain, or other character that you want to see more or less of, like an ongoing story, complication, scene, etc.
    - An area where another player's Hero could be stronger or weaker
    - Praise or other feedback for a player’s performance (including the Editor)
- After going through everyone’s fan mail, each Hero’s player can do one of these:
    - raise an existing trait by 1 level, or take a new trait at level 1
    - gain or lose 2 levels of a complication
    - exchange 3 total levels of traits or complications to something else
    - “reboot/retcon” the character, by rewriting them according to the new-character rules
- The Editor can put a cap on gained conditions & traits, e.g. a maximum of 8 for traits and 6 for complications
- You don’t have to change the things mentioned in fan mail, but you should
- Use complications to develop rivalries or romances, mark grudges or milestones, or anything else where your character is growing and changing
# Pages and Panels
## Using pages and panels
- When Heroes enter combat or otherwise need to get something done under time pressure, the Editor can start keeping track of pages and panels
- Each page consists of six panels, numbered 1-6
- Every page, each Hero, and every major Editor-controlled character in the scene, place themselves into three panels
    - When players decide where to place themselves, go in order from highest current resolve to lowest
    - The Editor can veto placements that don’t make sense, e.g. if one character is in New York and another is in Los Angeles, they can’t be in the same panel unless they’re on a video call or something similar
    - At the Editor’s discretion, Heroes can have more (or fewer) panels to work with, e.g. if there are only two Heroes, the Editor might give players four panels per page to fill
- Once everyone is placed in their panels, work out what happens in each panel
## Initiative and Interactions
- Actions in each panel are handled in order from lowest resolve to highest
- If you aren’t in a panel, you don’t act during that time, but you can’t be acted upon
    - The environment is always considered to be “on panel”
## Actions in a Panel
- When it’s your turn, you can do one of each of the following:
    - You can move around, pick things up, and otherwise interact with the world in any way that isn’t either risky or contested
    - You can invoke one trait or complication for action, either on its own or targeting someone or something else in the panel
- At any time during the panel, you can do the following:
    - You can invoke for action to resist someone else’s action
    - You can invoke one trait or complication for resolve
- At the end of everyone’s actions, if nobody invoked any traits or complications, one player whose Hero is in the panel can declare an **establishing shot**
    - Establishing shots can include civilian reactions, crumbling buildings, cool special effects, dramatic monologue, or anything else that rewards the fans for reading the comic and drives action
    - The player’s Hero gains 3 resolve
- If nobody acts in a panel, or the panel is empty, the Editor may fill it as they like, e.g. by adding scene complications such as endangered civilians or collateral damage
# Advice for Hero players
## How do I represent specific powers or situations?
- **Armor**: buy a trait that represents your armor, e.g. “Iron Skin”. Either defend against attacks with this trait, or invoke it for resolve
- **Mind Control**: roll for effect to create a complication like “Mind Controlled”, which is Common, so e.g. 12 points of effect yields a level 4 complication that can be invoked to make someone obey an order (or take a -4 penalty while fighting it)
    - The same principle can be applied to grappling or other constraints on action
- **Super-Speed**: no matter how fast you move, you’re still only present in the panels where you’re present, and the mutual-effect rule means you can’t damage people with impunity. You can still use a Super-Speed type power as a defense against attacks (“I run faster than he can aim”), or move out of range of someone’s attacks during a panel
## What are my self-defense options in combat?
- If you go first in a panel, you can just run away. If you have movement powers your opponent doesn’t, and that would take you out of their reach, this is perfectly okay.
    - If your opponent has some way of contesting your movement, you have to invoke for action, though - for example, if you’re flying but your opponent can shoot a net at you
- You can invoke for action at any time to defend yourself, and pay resolve
- You can invoke for resolve if you run low - look for traits or complications that would justify you staying in the fight, but which you have a hard time invoking for action, and lock them
- You can place yourself in empty panels and describe establishing shots to build up resolve for free, but this is slow
## What’s the logic behind invoking traits and complications?
- Maneuver yourself into a place to use your best traits, then invoke them
- Make the situation more dramatic for yourself by bringing complications into play, but you also get more effect when you do so
- Complications are a great source of resolve generation
    - Rivalry With Evilon 4 means you can regain 12 resolve and say “I won’t let you get away with this!” and stand up again, for example
## How about trading traits/complications for resolve?
- This is how you sustain yourself in a fight, including “heroic second winds”
- Do you have a secret ID? A dependent NPC? Something you’re fighting for? Invoke it for resolve! You’ll last longer than someone who’s just fighting for fighting’s sake
# Advice for Editors
## Creating adversaries
- You only need to provide details for adversaries down to the level where they have a name
    - Individual villains are named
    - Groups of henchmen are named, e.g. “Evilon’s Goons”, but individual henchmen aren’t, so treat the group as a single character
- Create villains just like you would create Hero characters: with traits and complications
- You can supply traits to villains during play, if you don’t have specific ideas before the fight begins
- When you add a trait to a villain in play, make sure to narrate some appropriate fiction. For example, if you add “Reinforcements 6” to a gang of henchmen, describe the additional guys pouring into the room through doors or windows
## Creating scene complications
- Think about who could reasonably overcome the problem, and price the complication accordingly:
    - An ordinary human could take care of it: 1-2
    - A top-tier (e.g. Olympic athlete) human: 3-4
    - A typical superhero task: 5-6
    - A challenging superhero task: 7-8
- Break huge challenges into smaller pieces, both to give players a chance and to let multiple PCs handle something
    - Example: the dam is about to burst! This could be broken into “Damaged dam 8”, “Water pressure 6”, “Safety valve stuck 4”, and so on.
## Using traits
- The Editor can attach traits and complication to anything, not just Heroes
    - Example: you can supply a “team trait” like “Heroic League resources 4”, letting characters take advantage of teleporters, science labs, and spaceships owned by their team
    - Don’t go overboard with this. Only create stuff where a roll will actually come up
